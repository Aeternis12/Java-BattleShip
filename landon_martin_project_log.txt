-------------------------------------------------


November 4:
    - created github and invited group mate to it. It took him a few weeks to join, but it all worked out.


December 1:
    - Fixed the .gitignore file from additions that were accidentally pushed to the github, including the .iml, .class
      files.
    - added the src folder and reorganized all the existing .java files into it.
    - Added board class functionality, with tracking each grid location's state within the board
    - Added CellButton class and functionality. This sorta represents the view part of rudimentary MVC practice.
      CellButton has its own state, similar to that of the Board class grid locations, and stores if its a member of the
      left board or right board (Player 2 or 1 respectively). Each CellButton is connected to the board within the
      Battleship class, and changes color depending on state.
    - Additionally added large logic restructuring on Battleship.java, to make sure it worked well with CellButton and
      Board classes.

December 2:
    - Added an abstract Ship class, which contains its name, length, if its horizontal or not, and its starting row and
      column. Also has a placeShip function which sets its member data to the passed through variables. Added occupies
      grid location function to see if a ship is at a certain row and column. Ship class also keeps track of how many
      hits a ship has received and if its as much as its length.
    - Added all 4 subclasses to the Ship class, including Cruiser, Carrier, BattleshipShip and Destroyer. Each has its
      own constructor, which passed through the length and name.
    - Added the Ship class and its subclass functionality to the board, making a board have and ArrayList of ships and
      tracking their grid locations.
    - Added random ship placement. This was done before manual to see if we could simply get the ships to show up on the
      board in the first place, and track if they have been hit. This is done through logic determining if a ship can be
      placed on a range of grid locations, then another function to actually place the ship.
    - Added the letters and numbers next to each player's board, corresponding to grid locations. This was done by
      creating two additional panels, one with numbers and one with letters, and then adding those and the board panel
      to a larger panel container.

December 3:
    - Undertook large restructuring of the Battleship.java class, cleaning up and modularizing much of the code, making
      it way easier to read and understand. Many functions were very long and unwieldy, doing numerous tasks, so I
      separated them into multiple functions.
    - Also reorganized the layout of the functions and member data, adding comments to properly label what sections of
      functions were.

December 4:
    - Added initially rudimentary ship placement, allowing players to place their own ships. This included a hovering
      feature, where you can see where the ship is going to be placed. The grid locations where the ship is hovering
      would be green if you could place the ship there and red if you could not. Added all the logic and functionality
      that came along with placing ships.
    - Added the ability to rotate which direction the ship would be placed, horizontal or vertical.
    - Added the ability to cycle through which ships you could place. Done by adding buttons to the top of the panel,
      clicking the button changes which ship you are selecting to place down. Added the button logic and disabling the
      buttons if you already placed the maximum amount of that ship
    - Modularized the constructor of the Battleship class, putting each section - game state, user interface, the
      listeners, etc - into their own function so that the Battleship constructor is nice and simple.
    - Finally, re-integrated random placement back in, through a button a user can click when its their turn to place
      ships and they haven't placed any ships yet. If they place a ship manually, the button is disabled. Places ships
      randomly using the same logic as the random placement before, but had to reconnect it through a new function to
      the CellButtons and such.
