Non-intuitive interface instructions are provided in text mid-game.

Additional Rules:
Salvo Mode! - Each user fires multiple shots per turn: equal to the number of ships they have remaining. Normal "keep turn after hit" rules do not apply in Salvo Mode. For instance, if you have all 5 ships remaining, you shoot 5 times, whether you hit or miss. When you have 4 ships remaining, you shoot 4 times, etc.

Random Placement:
    Allows for each player to get their ships randomly placed if they havent placed any ships yet. Switches to next players turn afterward.
